just a disposable test repository

This link is ok, but doesn't render: 
[link to doc.html source](doc.html)

This link doesn't work:
[link to rendered html]https://htmlpreview.github.com/?(doc.html)

This link doesn't work:
[link to rendered html](https://htmlpreview.github.com/?doc.html)

This one also links to the source: [absolute link](https://github.com/Schparky/test/blob/master/doc.html)

This one should render, but is absolute as well: [absolute rendered HTML](https://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/Schparky/test/blob/master/doc.html)

Another source link: [doc.html]

Or this: (doc.html)[doc.html]

Only this works: [doc.html](doc.html)
